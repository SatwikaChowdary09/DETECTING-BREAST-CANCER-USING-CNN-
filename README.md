# Breast Cancer Detection Using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on medical data. The model is trained on a dataset with features representing tumor characteristics and predicts whether a tumor is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).
## Features
- Data preprocessing and reshaping for CNN input
- CNN architecture built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training with accuracy and loss tracking
- Model evaluation and prediction examples
- Saved trained model for future use
## How to Use
1. Load the dataset (`data.csv` or your dataset).
2. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the CNN model.
3. Use the saved model to make predictions on new data.
## Output
- The model outputs `1` for malignant (cancerous) tumors.
- The model outputs `0` for benign (non-cancerous) tumors.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Feel free to explore and improve the model!
